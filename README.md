**I'm a programmer on beta release!**


Hi! My name is Tassia and for a long time I've wanted to start programming. This quarantine I had an opportunity to focus on it and change my life completely!


I've always been a person that if I didn't know how to make something :mag: I'd find out how to do it, so programming has been a perfect fit for me.


:mortar_board: I have a bachelor's degree on Movies and Audiovisuals :movie_camera: and previously was working as an assistant director, so naturally when I came to programming I wanted to be on the more narrative side of things, so my focus is to learn game development languages :video_game: in the future and enter the industry.


 :book: Right now, I'm doing the Ironhack Bootcamp and currently working on learning ReactJS, NodeJS and other technologies for front and back end. 
 
 
I like movies, games, books, all things narrative and also love to create!
